# Welcome to FaceUp Full-stack exercise ðŸ’™!

Dear candidate,

Welcome to the full-stack developer assignment. In this task, you will be creating a simple application with a backend and a frontend service.
Right from the very start, we encourage you to use AI as you wish. Some of the work that is required here can be done very efficiently using AI, and being efficient is what we want from ourselves and our colleagues.
Just bear in mind that you'll be __asked to briefly explain everything you have submitted__ (and we can be *quite nit-picky* if we see that you don't understand something that was generated).

## So, what's the task?

Please create an application that works similarly to ours but is as simple as possible. Your task is to develop a record-keeping system where users can create alerts (records), view all created records, and see their details. In the record details, users should be able to edit and delete records. There's no need to implement user registration and login flowsâ€”everything can operate under a fixed single "account."

We'd like each alert to include at least:

- The sender's name  
- The sender's age  
- The ability to upload files  

If you'd like to try our application and see what our interface looks like visually, go to [https://app.nntb.cz](https://www.app.nntb.cz) â€“ please select "**TestovacÃ­ Å¡kola**."

## Technical details?

Please create the project using **Node.js, TypeScript & React**, otherwise feel free to use whatever you're most comfortable with. We are generally **GQL + PostgreSQL** based, but if you prefer a REST API or a DynamoDB, it will do just fine. The key thing for us is that you **understand why you chose the technologies you did**.

## What are we looking for?  

It's not about **what you can do**, but **how you do it**. Focus on:

- **Clean, readable, and well-typed code**  
- **A reasonable structure for FE and BE, with proper use of frameworks and libraries**  
- **Your own understanding of the code and your ability to explain it**  
- **DB consistency, constraints, transactions, etc.**
- **Maintainable API and DB design**

## What we don't want from you?
- Everything in one commit.
- Similarly, everything is in one or two files.
- Code you have copy-pasted or generated that you don't understand.
- Code that does not work.

## Tips and tricks
- Commit well and commit often. It's a great practice, and we will be delighted to review tidy commits.
- Make notes of your decisions. It will be easier to explain afterward.
- Think, then code, then refine.
- Format and lint stuff.
- If you don't understand something or you have found a problem with the assignment, message us.
- If you're short on time, focus on quality rather than trying to implement everything. We'd rather see a well-structured, maintainable partial solution than a rushed, messy full implementation.
- Be like [grug](https://grugbrain.dev/).

You don't need to deploy the final projectâ€”send us a link to a public Git repository. We'll review the repo, and if we have any questions, we'll discuss them on a call.
